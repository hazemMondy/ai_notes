the loos function isn't straight forward

the stopping criteria also not obvious like supervised models where we check the accuracy, loss.
human must test the model to evaluate the training

Despite their flexibility, generative models can be more challenging to train due to the **complexity** of learning the data ==distribution==. 

They also may not perform as well as discriminative models in tasks that primarily require accurate classification.
