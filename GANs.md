as we don't know the two distributions, thus we can't know if the training is done or not
so we want to compare the two distributions [[Distribution comparison formulas]] 

at best case of training the fake = real = 50% i.e. good discriminator doesn't which to decide

### training
![](attachment/af7f149f1d754238a4a0adb3eb5f62d9.png)

1st term if we sampled an image from the data the D want to classify = 1 (real)
2nd term in if we sampled an image from the Z latent space the DG(z) term:
* the D want it to be = 0 (fake)
	* thus, D want to maximize this side (1-DG(z))
* the G want it to be = 1 (real)
	* thus, G want to minimize this side (1-DG(z))


### gradient

We are not minimizing any overall loss! No training curves to look at! ðŸ˜¢

the second case of #vanishinggradient but in the beginning of the training

Optimal training case
	This minimax game achieves its global minimum when pG = pdata!

### training problems of GANs
vanishing gradients is solved

3) training oscillation in the min max property![](attachment/c24c6b71df95b432aa691289fc0fd214.png)
state 1: x, y are + then v is +
max(y) will maximize y and min(x) will minimize x
state 2: x is - and y is + thus v is -
max(y) to maximize y it will make it - to make v +
â€¦ till return to the first state

4) same generated class from G to get maximum reward from D ![](attachment/7fa60d60ebca3238c6588d18ead960d0.png)
5) the Distribution divergence formula can make very big difference in the training
